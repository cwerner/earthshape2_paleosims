# EarthShape Phase 2 LPJ-GUESS paleo vegetation simulations

This repo holds paleovegetation simulations and analysis for Earthshape Phase 2.

All runs conducted using LPJ-GUESS v4.0 (with subpixel mod) and Chile regional PFT
parametrization (see [Werner et al., 2018 ESurf](https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/6/829/2018/)).
